          Your California Privacy Rights and Choices
        </h1>
        <p>
          If you are a California resident, the CCPA provides you with
          additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. This
          section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those
          rights.
        </p>
        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">
          (1) Right to Access Your Information
        </h1>
        <p>
          You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to
          you about our collection and use of your personal information during
          the 12-month period preceding your request. Once we receive and verify
          your request, we will disclose to you the information that you request
          and we are obligated to provide under the CCPA, which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="list-disc">

        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">(2) Right to Request Deletion</h1>
        <p>
          You have the right to request that we delete some or all of the
          personal information that we have collected from you, subject to
          certain exceptions. Once we receive and verify your request, we will
          delete (and direct our service providers to whom we have furnished
          that information to also delete) your personal information from our
          (and their) records. With respect to the exceptions, we may deny your
          deletion request in whole or in part if retaining your personal
          information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal

          received explicit notice and are provided with an opportunity to
          opt-out of the sale of your personal information. You (or your
          authorized representative) may submit your request to opt-out by using
          the form available on this page.

        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">
          Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
        </h1>
        <p>
          To exercise the access, data portability, deletion and opt-out rights
          described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by
          Emailing us compliance@getlocalcontractors.com Only you or a person
          registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize
          to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related
          to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer
          request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable
          consumer request for access or data portability twice within a
          12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: Provide
          sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the
          person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized
          representative. This includes your or the consumer’s:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="list-disc">Name</li>
          <li className="list-disc">Email</li>
          <li className="list-disc">Address</li>
          <li className="list-disc">Current Mailing Address</li>
          <li className="list-disc">Alternate Phone</li>
          <li className="list-disc">Alternate Mailing Address</li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your
            expectations based on your relationship with us;
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Other personal information about you maintained by us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
          properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Generally, we will
          not request additional information from you for purposes of
          verification. If, however, we cannot verify you identity from the
          information already maintained by us, we may request additional
          information from you, which shall only be used for the purposes of
          verifying you identity and seeking to exercise you rights under the
          CCPA, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
          any new personal information collected for the purposes of
          verification as soon as practical after processing your request,
          except as required to comply with the CCPA. We cannot respond to your
          request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
          your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
          personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer
          request does not require you to create an account with us. We may
          require authentication that is reasonable in light of the nature of
          the personal information requested and will only use personal
          information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
          requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Please note
          that we may continue to share your personal information with our
          affiliates and service providers for essential purposes described
          above and other such circumstances allowed under the CCPA. Opting out
          of the sale of personal information through the “Do Not Sell My
          Personal information” link does not mean that you will stop seeing
          ads, including some interest-based ads. To learn more about
          interest-based advertising across sites and additional opt-out
          choices, please see our general Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">(3) Use of an Authorized Agent</h1>
        <p>
          If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a
          request to delete, we may require that you provide the authorized
          agent written permission and require the authorized agent to verify
          its own identity with us. A power of attorney to your authorized agent
          is an acceptable form of authorization. We may deny a request from an
          agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you
          to act on your behalf.
        </p>
        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">(3) How we Verify your Request</h1>
        <p>
          When you submit a request to delete, or a request to know, we verify
          your request by taking the following steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="list-disc">
            We may match the information you provided in your request with the
            personal information of the consumer already maintained by us; or
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            We may use a third-party identity verification service that complies
            with the CCPA;
          </li>
        </ul>
        When verifying a request, we consider the following factors:
        <ul>
          <li className="list-disc">
            The type, sensitivity, and value of the personal information
            collected and maintained about you;
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            The risk of harm to you posed by any unauthorized access or
            deletion;
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            The likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek the
            personal information;
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Whether the personal information to be provided by you to verify
            your identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent
            requests or being spoofed or fabricated
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            The manner in which we interact with you; and
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            The technology available for verification.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you request to know categories of personal information, we verify
          your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty. When you request to
          delete, we verify your identity to a reasonable degree or a reasonably
          high degree of certainty depending on the sensitivity of the personal
          information and the risk of harm to you posed by unauthorized
          deletion. In all cases, we verify by matching the identifying
          information provided with the request to the personal information of
          the consumer already maintained by us.
        </p>
        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">Response Timing and Format</h1>
        <p>
          Upon receiving a request to know or a request to delete, we will
          confirm receipt of the request within 15 days and provide information
          about how we will process the request. We strive to respond to a
          verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we
          require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason
          and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response
          by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide
          will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the
          verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain
          the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For these
          requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information
          that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
          information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. We do
          not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer
          request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
          If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why
          we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
          completing your request.
        </p>
        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">(4) Right to Non-Discrimination</h1>
        We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights
        under the CCPA. For example, we will not:
        <ul>
          <li className="list-disc">Deny you goods or services.</li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services,
            including through the use of discounts or other benefits, or
            imposing penalties.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Suggest that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or
            services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Please know that we may charge you a different price or rate or provide
        a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is
        reasonably related to the value provided to you by your personal
        information.
        <h1 className="font-bold font-lg">Changes to Our Privacy Notice</h1>
        We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and
        at any time. When we make changes to this privacy notice (which will be
        updated at least once every 12 months), we will notify you through a
        notice on this page: Privacy Policy.
